# Artificial Intelligence

## What is AI

* Artificial Intelligence \(AI\) refers to computer systems capable of performing tasks that historically required human intelligence\.

    * When most people use the term AI today\, theyâ€™re often referring to machine learning\-powered technologies that enable machines to perform tasks previously exclusive to humans\, such as generating written content\, steering a car\, or analyzing data\. ðŸ¤–ðŸŒŸ

    *  recognizing speech

    * identifying patterns

## Types of AI

* Realized AI

    * **Narrow AI**

        * performs a narrow task

        * needs Humans to train

        * **Reactive Machine AI**

            * **are systems designed to perform a very specific specialized task\. **

            * Reactive AI stems from statistical math\, and it can analyze vast amounts of data to produce a seemingly intelligent output\.

            * We've had reactive AI since the 1990s\, IBM's chess playing supercomputer "Deep Blue" beat grandmaster Garry Kasparov by analyzing the pieces on the board and predicting the probable outcomes of each move\.

                * That's a  specialized task with a lot of available data   to create insights\. The hallmark of reactive AI\.  

                    * limited memory AI

                        * This form of AI can recall past events and outcomes and monitor specific objects over time to  achieve a desired outcome

                        * can improve in performance

                        * like ChatGPT

* Theoretical AI

    * Artificial Genereral Intelligence

        * agi can use previous learnings and skills to accomplish new tasks in different context\, without the need for us humans to train the underlying models\. If AGI wants to learn it does by itself\.

    * Super AI

        * if ever realized\, super AI would think\, reason\, learn\, make judgements and possess cognitive abilities that surpass those of human beings and be able to feel emotions\, have needs and possess beliefes and desires of their own\.
