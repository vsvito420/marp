**What is AI?**
- AI(=Artificial Intelligence).
  - It refers to computer systems that perform tasks requiring human intelligence.
  - AI can be used to 
    - automate tasks, 
    - analyze data, 
    - make decisions.

###### John McCarthy's definition 2004 :
- "It is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs. 
It is related to the similar task of using computers to understand human intelligence, but AI does not have to confine itself to methods that are biologically observable."

### Misconceptions about AI
- when most people use the term AI today, theyâ€™re often referring to machine learning. 
  - Machine Learning: 
    - enables machines to perform tasks *previously exclusive* to humans:
      - recognizing speech
      - identifying images
      - understanding natural language
      - making decisions
---

### What is Machine Learning?
- ML= Machine Learning. 
It is a subset of AI that enables machines to learn from data and improve over time.

### Types of AI
- **Realized AI**
- **Theoretical AI**
---

### Types of AI
- **Realized AI**   
  - **Narrow AI**: 
    - Specific tasks, needs training from Human input.
  - **Reactive AI**: 
    - Analyzes data for intelligent output.
  - **Limited Memory AI**: 
    - Recalls past events, 
    - improves over time (e.g., ChatGPT).
---
### Types of AI
**Theoretical AI**
- **Artificial General Intelligence**: 
  - Learns without human training.
- **Super AI**: 
  - Hypothetical, beyond human abilities.
---

**History of AI**
- 1952: 
Arthur Samuel writes the first computer learning application.
- 1956: 
The Word "Artificial intelligence" got coined by John McCarthy.
- 1969: 
"Shakey" was the first General purpose mobile robot built
- 1997: 
Supercomputer "Deep Blue" was designed by IBM. it defeated the word chess champion in a game.
---

**History of AI**
- 2002: 
  First commercially successful robotic vacuum cleaner created (Roomba).
- 2019: 
  OpenAI releases the GPT-2 language model.
- 2020:
  Waymo launches Waymo One, a fully autonomous taxi service in the Phoenix area, marking a significant milestone in self driving car technology.
---
**History of AI**
- 2022: 
  Open AI debuts ChatGPT, an AI chatbot build on GPT 3.5
- 2023: 
  The leaked LLaMA AI Language model
---

**AI in the Future**
## AI is expected to...
- have a significant impact on the future of work, healthcare, and transportation.
- create new jobs and industries, but it may also lead to job displacement and economic inequality.
- continue to improve and become more integrated into our daily lives.
- raise ethical and social issues that will need to be addressed.
