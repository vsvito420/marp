 ### Image Description: 
 >A Roboter with an A.I. Tshirt has a Headset on his head and says "Human Resources Department, How may I help You?

 ### My Observation:
 > "The robot in the image is wearing an 'A.I.' t-shirt, indicating that it is an artificial intelligence system. The fact that it is working in a human resources department suggests that AI is being **used to perform tasks traditionally done by humans**".
