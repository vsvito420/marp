 ### Image Description: 
 >A Roboter with an A.I. Tshirt has a Headset on his head and says "Human Resources Department, How may I help You?

 ### My Observation:
 > "The robot in the image is wearing an 'A.I.' t-shirt, indicating that it is an artificial intelligence system. The fact that it is working in a human resources department suggests that AI is being **used to perform tasks traditionally done by humans**".

 ## Vocabulary

 - Artificial Intelligence (AI)
   > Computer systems designed to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence.
- Human Resources (HR)
  > The department in a company responsible for hiring, training, and managing employees.
