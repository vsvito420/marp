# Artificial intelligence
**Artificial intelligence (AI)** is the intelligence of machines or software, as opposed to the intelligence of humans or other animals. It is a field of study in computer science that develops and studies intelligent machines. Such machines may be called AIs.

## History
**The history of AI** can be traced back to ancient myths and legends, as well as early attempts to create mechanical devices that could mimic human abilities. The term "artificial intelligence" was coined by John McCarthy in 1956, at a conference where the field was officially founded. The field went through multiple cycles of optimism and disappointment, and experienced a resurgence in the 2010s with the success of deep learning.

## Goals
**The goals of AI research** are centered around particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The traditional goals include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and robotics. General intelligence (the ability to complete any task performable by a human) is among the field's long-term goals.

## Tools
**The tools of AI research** include a variety of techniques that can be used to solve different problems. Some of the most common tools are search and optimization, logic, probabilistic methods, neural networks, deep learning, and generative AI.

## Applications
**The applications of AI** are widespread and diverse, ranging from industry, government, and science to entertainment, art, and education. Some of the most prominent applications are web search engines, recommendation systems, speech recognition, natural language processing, computer vision, self-driving cars, gaming, and creative tools.

## Risks and challenges
**The risks and challenges of AI** are related to the ethical, social, and economic implications of developing and deploying intelligent systems. Some of the major issues include privacy, surveillance, bias, discrimination, accountability, transparency, safety, security, warfare, employment, and existential risk.
